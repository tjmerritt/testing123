GITHUB!  [Visit GitHub!](http://www.github.com).

URL autolinking is demonstrated by how the url http://www.github.com/ is handled.

We also have ~~strikethrough~~.

Bash shell script highlighting
```bash
for h in hosts{1..3}; do echo $h; done
```

## This is a table:

Col1  | Col2
------|-------
Val1a | Val2a
Val1b | Val2b

We can also use limited HTML formating as show <b>here</b>.

More fun with tables:

|Col1  | Col2  |
|:-----|------:|
|Val1a | Val2a |
|Val1b | Val2b |

Ok, lets try an HTML table

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Col1</th>
        <th>Col2</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Val1a</td>
            <td>Val2a</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Val1b</td>
            <td>Val2b</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Ok, How about a mixed table

|Col1  | Col2  |
|:-----|------:|
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Val1a</td>
        <td>Val2a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Val1b</td>
        <td>Val2b</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
